I will post documentation about pattern tables, nametables and attribute
tables here, for the sake of keeping everything in one place.

Pattern tables - the Graphics data in the ROM. In technical terms, what's
inside the CHR ROM. The pattern table is always mapped to the CHR part of
the ROM.

Nametable - This is where info gets muddy, since NESDev doesn't even seem
to ever mentions what do these contain. These contain pointers, or
indexes, to the pattern tables.

Attribute table - A nametable also comes with this. These hold pointers,
or indexes, to the palette table.

To create a pixel, fetch an entry from the nametable, look it up on the
pattern table, fetch the attribute for that entry, look it up on the
palette table, and send pixel info.

*** How to write to a nametable ***
we shouldn't care about this, since it's from the game programmer's
perspective, but we shall learn about it to understand the PPU.
first you want to set up PPU CTRL so it selects the right nametable and
other stuff. then you want to select an address to write to using PPU
ADDR ($2006) like so:
    lda #$21
    sta $2006
    lda #$08
    sta $2006
PPU ADDR is write twice. after writing to this reg, you have to use
PPU DATA to write... data to vram. note that this must be done when
the screen is black, i.e. during v-blank. an example: set next 200 bytes
to 0:
        ldx #$00
        lda #$00
  loop: sta $2007
        cpx #$c8    ; 200 in hex
        bne loop
a better example can be found in Super Mario Bros's disassembly. it has a
routine called "InitializeNameTables" which does exactly that. There you
can find the details, this is only a high-level (and probably incorrect)
overview.

*** Writing to OAM ***
you may notice that OAM ADDR ($2003) and OAM DATA ($2004) are basically the
equivalent of those described earlier... yep it's the same strategy. what's
interesting is that OAM DMA ($4014) also exists. (description to be written
later).

*** Scrolling ***
it's simple. the value in PPU SCROLL ($2005) is the top left corner. the value
itself is the low byte an index, or pointer, into a nametable. the high byte
is indicated by bit 0 and 1 of PPU CTRL ($2000). example: let's say i want
to render starting from the middle of nametable 1 (horizontal). then:
    lda #$80    ; x coord
    sta $2005
    lda #$00    ; y coord
    lda #%00000001  ; select nametable 1
