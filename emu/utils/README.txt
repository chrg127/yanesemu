    cmdargs.*       Simple library for command line arguments. Supports only a
                    few options.
    debug.hpp       A bunch of debug related constructs.
    file.*          A simple and general file class. Almost everything is inlined
                    to the C FILE * API.
    stringops.*     A library of useful string operations. It doesn't have
                    everything, I add functions to it whenever I need them.
